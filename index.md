### Rocording of some beautiful words

Recently, there was announced a problem which while it certainly seemed to belong to geometry, was nevertheless so designed that it did not call for the determination of magnitude, nor could it be solved by quantitative calculation; consequently I did not hesitate to assign it to the geometry of position, especially since the solution required only the consideration of position, calculation being of no use.
