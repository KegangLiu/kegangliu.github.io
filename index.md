Here is a place for formulating some of my ideas aidded by words and publicity. Hope it would be of some sort of utility. 

# About me

## Identity in physical world
Just an explorer trying to touch the real world with real dimensions, for this is one of the few meanings I can recognize, for having a high mental state and a high view. I'm satisfying with the situation I'm within.

## Identity in my mental world 
- An entiety of fool, who has been exploring deeply and building so-so many beautiful cognitions, without being capable of being harmonic with them. 
- A loser with numerous failures, who hasn't even made mind to do something at all cost.
- A fighter, never giving up and always accompanied and inspired by cognition.

## Interests

### Invariance
Invariance is autually the property or characteristics of entities, which remain unchangable. Such a notion is so ubiquitous, exemplified by physical laws assumed to be invariant, without any proving backing up.
1. Topolygical invariance. Relaxing some existence like geometrical equiavalence, the topology explore more unchangeable/invariant property. That's the place of topology in my interior, namely controlling the degree of invariance with consiousness. It has a prospect on qualitive/exsitence analysis and notion of topological matter, like topological quantum matter where qubits susceptible to disturbance would remain invariant in the facet of information.
2. Symmetry. Higher symmetry. The objects remain the same under some geometrical transformation. Such symmetry would induce some beautiful effects on the interaction with fields, serving an important stategy in manipulating the fields, comprising EM field in photonic crytal/periodic structure.
3. Scaling invariance built on fractal time-space, where quantum mechanics can be built on the ground of deeper and concise principle, scaling invariance. Although such a theory hasn't been developing enough, there are many ideas fantastic within it.

### Vibration and wave. 
In my view, wave and vibration shall be one of essential phenomena in nature. For any function which is absolute-value integrable and satisfies Dirichlet condition, can be decomposed into harmonic vibration in the frequency space.

### Cybernetics
Controlling is always an important term in my mind.

# Move on

## Projects ongoing or somewhat finished
1. Intelligent forward-wave amplifer design, which would change the traditional design process.
2. Multi-dimensional uncertainty analysis in data-driven perspective, which would improve analytic capability and possibility.
3. Quantitative horizontal evalution of devices/a positioning system for a device in performance space.


# Some beautiful words I resonate with, just a side of me

Recently, there was announced a problem which while it certainly seemed to belong to geometry, was nevertheless so designed that it did not call for the determination of magnitude, nor could it be solved by quantitative calculation; consequently I did not hesitate to assign it to the geometry of position, especially since the solution required only the consideration of position, calculation being of no use.
