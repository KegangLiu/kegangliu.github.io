Here is a place for formulating some of my ideas aidded by words and publicity. Hope it would be of some sort of utility. 

# About me

## Identity in physical world
I'm pursuing Ph.D. degree in physical electroncis in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Basically, the goal I'm approaching at this stage is the realization of terahertz vacuum electronic source. I have been

## Identity in my mental world 
- An entiety of fool, who has been exploring deeply and building so-so many beautiful cognitions, without being capable of being harmonic with them. 
- A loser with numerous failures, who hasn't even made mind to do something at all cost.
- A fighter, never giving up.

### Invariance
Invariance is autually the property or characteristics of entities, which remain unchangable. Such a notion is so ubiquitous, exemplified by physical laws assumed to be invariant, without any proving backing up.
1. Topolygical invariance. Relaxing some existence like geometrical equiavalence, the topology explore more unchangeable/invariant property. That's the place of topology in my interior, namely controlling the degree of invariance with consiousness. It has a prospect on qualitive/exsitence analysis and notion of topological matter, like topological quantum matter where qubits susceptible to disturbance would remain invariant in the facet of information.
2. Symmetry. Higher symmetry. The objects remain the same under some geometrical transformation.

Recently, there was announced a problem which while it certainly seemed to belong to geometry, was nevertheless so designed that it did not call for the determination of magnitude, nor could it be solved by quantitative calculation; consequently I did not hesitate to assign it to the geometry of position, especially since the solution required only the consideration of position, calculation being of no use.
